## How it works on race day

1. Paddy opens carnivaltiming.com, joins WD26 as Admin
2. Marshals join WD26 as XC Marshal
3. Each race: Admin arms, fires GO, marshals record bibs (name auto-shows)
4. After each race: Admin publishes results — appear on sportcarnival.com.au live
5. sportcarnival.com.au already connected to WD26, updates in real-time
